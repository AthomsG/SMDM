This README.md will work as a to-do list.

## Questions for the Teacher

  - [ ] What to do about the missing values? Some variables have a lot of them...

## 1st Submission

### Introductory Text

We have to write a text explining the dataset and the classificatin problem that we're solving. It's important to describe the variable types that are found on the dataset (binary, ordinal and real) and to explain our approach (i.e. Data pre-processing techniques and classification models used).

This part should be the focus of less code inclined group members. (has been done aside from the data-set exploration)

### Data Pre-processing & Visualization
  - [ ] Dealing with missing data
  - [ ] One-hot encoding nominal (Done)
  - [ ] Real -> Nominal -> One-hot encoding
  - [ ] Outlier Deteticion (?)
  - [ ] Chi-Squared (Done)

### Classification
  - [ ] KNN
  - [ ] Naive-Bayes 
  - [ ] let's use K-fold to train the models
  #### Extra Models if we have time
      SVM
      Logistic Regression
  
### Model Comparison

### Some Ideias

Can we use knn one binary and continuous variables? Read [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/271043/k-nearest-neighbour-with-continuous-and-binary-variables)
