# SMDM

This README.md will work as a to-do list.

## 1st Submission

### Introductory Text

We have to write a text explining the dataset and the classificatin problem that we're solving. It's important to describe the variable types that are found on the dataset (binary, ordinal and real) and to explain our approach (i.e. Data pre-processing techniques and classification models used).

This part should be the focus of less code inclined group members.

### Data Pre-processing & Visualization
  - [ ] Dealing with missing data
  - [ ] One-hot encoding nominal
  - [ ] Real -> Nominal -> One-hot encoding
  - [ ] Outlier Deteticion (?)
  - [ ] Chi-Squared

### Classification
  - [ ] KNN
  - [ ] Naive-Bayes 
  - [ ] let's use K-fold to train the models
  #### Extra Models if we have time
      SVM
      Logistic Regression
  
### Model Comparison
