This README.md will work as a to-do list.

## Questions for the Teacher

  - [ ] What to do about the missing values? Some variables have a lot of them...

## 1st Submission

### Introductory Text

We have to write a text explining the dataset and the classificatin problem that we're solving. It's important to describe the variable types that are found on the dataset (binary, ordinal and real) and to explain our approach (i.e. Data pre-processing techniques and classification models used).

This part should be the focus of less code inclined group members. (has been done aside from the data-set exploration)

### Data Pre-processing & Visualization
  - [ ] Exploratory Plots (Use [Lab 2](https://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~ist13493/MEDM2023/Lab2_EDA_KNN_NB/Lab2_2022.html) as reference)
  - [ ] Dealing with missing data
  - [X] One-hot encoding nominal
  - [ ] Real -> Nominal -> One-hot encoding
  - [ ] Outlier Deteticion (?)
  - [X] Chi-Squared
  - [ ] How to deal with the imbalanced dataset

### Classification
  - [X] KNN
  - [ ] Naive-Bayes 
  - [ ] let's use K-fold to train the models
  - [ ] Why is the KNN **not sensitive** to an imbalanced dataset?
  - [ ] Why is the Na√Øve Bayes **sensitive** to an imbalanced dataset
  #### Extra Models if we have time
      SVM
      Logistic Regression
      Random Forest
  
### Model Comparison

  - [ ] Use F1-Score
  - [ ] Use ROC curves
 
### Some Ideias

Can we use knn one binary and continuous variables? Read [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/271043/k-nearest-neighbour-with-continuous-and-binary-variables)
